# 📈 Project Roadmap: GDPR Copilot Workspace Video Builder

---

## ✅ Version 1 (MVP / Launch)

- Polish subtitle backgrounds (BorderStyle=3, subtle semi-transparent box)
- Fine-tune global subtitle positioning (MarginV)
- Ensure all clips are 30 FPS, consistent GOP (15 or 30)
- Assemble final video without transitions (sharp professional cuts)
- Generate timestamped output filenames (optional, for clean version control)
- Clean project structure:
  - `/src/video_builder/`
  - Clear separation of trim, speedup, subtitles, assemble
- Centralized settings in `settings.py`
- Full final test export
- Create `README.md` for project usage and developer instructions

---

## 🚀 Version 1.5 (Quality of Life + Developer Happiness)

- Transform into full CLI application (using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/))
- Refactor code into Classes (OOP organization for cleaner scaling)
- Move configuration from `settings.py` to YAML / TOML file
- Allow **per-clip Subtitle MarginV** overrides (dynamic per clip)
- Allow single subtitle file for whole movie, automatically split during trimming
- Add error handling for missing clips / missing subtitles
- Auto filename timestamping for final video outputs
- Improved logging (with optional colors, using Rich or similar)

---

## 🎬 Version 2 (Major Creative & Studio Features)

- **Word-by-word subtitle animation** (CapCut-style dynamic reading)
- **Zoom-in / Zoom-out effects** on important parts
- **Rounded corners** on subtitle background boxes (via custom ASS scripting)
- **Background music soundtrack** (optional track blending)
- **Clip transition effects** (fade-in, fade-out, wipes, etc.)
- **Auto audio-based captions** (speech-to-text integration)
- **Smart auto-highlighting** (AI-based focus points)
- **Multi-template output profiles** (LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels)
- **Multi-language subtitle support** (for internationalization)
